# Super-spreader_paper

Welcome to the super-spreader project! The goal of this project is to build a complete disease transmission model (based on social networks) and then deliver individual risk-of-infection profile and super-spreading capability based on the social network interactions (Degree, quality of interaction, pathogen charactersitics [Refer paper]). 
Scripts for the following model (with a few variations are available):
1) Influenza model
2) Shigellosis transmission for 1 village (Hacienda San Juan)
3) Shigellosis transission (without quality of interaction)
4) Post simulation analysis for all villages
